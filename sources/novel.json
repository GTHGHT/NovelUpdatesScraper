  "description": "I\u2019m a very ordinary girl, with no interest in otome games, but was suddenly sucked into the world of the cliche Heartthrob Love Revolution.\nThat\u2019s all well and good, I\u2019m not exactly thrilled, but it\u2019s fine. However, why am I the heroine\u2019s older brother? I\u2019m a girl! My character is named Makoto, and I hang out with the Heroine to help her get together with the princely character and make it to the end credits.\nAll righty, I just need to support the Heroine while she does her best. If I do, I think I\u2019ll be able to go back to my world\u2026 but, why am I so popular? Hey, prince, don\u2019t you blush at me!",
